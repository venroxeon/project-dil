❤️ Project Overview

Our project uses AI to detect early signs of heart disease from real-time health data collected through wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness bands. These devices track important health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, and daily activity — and our AI model analyzes this data to identify potential risks.

But we don’t stop at detection — we also care about prevention.
Based on the user’s heart health insights, the system recommends personalized foods and dishes that can help improve overall heart wellness. Whether it’s suggesting nutrient-rich meals or balanced diet plans, our goal is to make healthy living simpler and smarter.

In short, this project brings together AI, healthcare, and nutrition to help people monitor, understand, and take better care of their hearts every day. 💓

/// ** EXAMPLE ** //

The wearable device (like a smartwatch) continuously tracks metrics such as heart rate, oxygen level, and activity.

This data is sent to your system right away (through an app, Bluetooth, or cloud).

Your AI model then analyzes it immediately to detect any unusual patterns or early signs of heart disease.

So instead of waiting for someone to upload or manually enter their data later, your system responds in the moment, giving the user live feedback or recommendations about their heart health.

👉 Example:
If someone’s heart rate spikes abnormally while resting, the system could instantly alert them and recommend taking a break, checking their blood pressure, or eating something heart-healthy.
